 Results that Matter . Come work with the best! We offer opportunity, unique challenges, and clear\\-sighted commitment to the mission. Objective. Responsive. Trusted. Veracity Forecasting Portfollio (VF) is part of the Sea, Land, Air Division within Systems Planning and Analysis, Inc.

 Everybody's view of data science is a little different, and we are no exception. In SPA's Veracity Forecasting Portfollio, we view data science as a way of understanding ""how the world works."" We make assumptions and models then use data of all sorts to validate or disprove them. Our customers ask tough questions about managing their multifaceted enterprises; we build and operate complex models and simulations to provide the answers that best address the decisions they face. We don't expect you to come in with all of the subject matter expertise needed to completely understand the data analysis or to create models with the fidelity we require. We do expect you to get there quickly, though. We look for traits such as how you solve problems when you're stuck. Do you look for creative ways to apply different techniques from tangential disciplines? Do you crack open a book and teach yourself how to do something new? Do you collaborate with your colleagues? If you take initiatives like these, you would fit in well with our team of analysts. We would love to tell you that we spend all our time developing elaborate algorithms for regression, survival, kernel weighting, etc., but honestly, we spend a lot of time wrangling data. This includes combing data from disparate data systems, manipulating formats, and cleaning\\-all of which are required to make the modeling happen. For this critical work we need someone who is precise, efficient, and tenacious. Qualifications
   

  

 Required Qualifications: Bachelor's degree in physical science, engineering, or mathematics.

Etched is building AI chips that are hard\\-coded for individual model architectures. Our first product (Sohu) only supports transformers, but has an order of magnitude more throughput and lower latency than a B200\\. With Etched ASICs, you can build products that would be impossible with GPUs, like real\\-time video generation models and extremely deep \\& parallel chain\\-of\\-thought reasoning agents.

**Role Summary**

We are seeking a highly skilled **Systems Validation Engineer** to take ownership of the full platform server product and ensure seamless integration, functionality, and performance. If you are passionate about AI, hardware, and systems architecture, and thrive in a fast\\-paced, hands\\-on environment, we’d love to hear from you.

**Key Responsibilities**

* 
Full Platform Ownership

+ 
Own the end\\-to\\-end validation of the full platform server product, including hardware, firmware, and software integration.

+ 
Develop and execute a comprehensive test plan to validate server functionality, performance, and reliability.


* 
Sohu Integration

+ 
Lead the integration of the Sohu platform into the server, ensuring full support for side\\-band communication, telemetry, and BMC (Baseboard Management Controller) integration.

+ 
Ensure that all system\\-level telemetry and communication channels are functioning correctly and efficiently.


* 
Debugging and Root Cause Analysis

+ 
Proactively identify, diagnose, and resolve critical system issues, driving root cause analysis to the component level.

+ 
Work closely with hardware, firmware, and software teams to address and resolve complex system\\-level issues.


* 
System\\-Level Expertise

+ 
Ensure proper functioning of all server subsystems, including power, thermal, storage, networking, and PCIe interfaces.

+ 
Evaluate and optimize system performance under various workloads and stress conditions.

+ 
Provide expert guidance on server architecture and component\\-level interactions.


* 
Command Line and Linux Expertise

+ 
Utilize Linux command line extensively for system validation, debugging, and monitoring.

+ 
Develop and maintain automated test scripts, diagnostic tools, and Python scripts.

+ 
Experience with IPMI protocol direct calls with BMC.


* 
Cross\\-Functional Collaboration

+ 
Collaborate with design, firmware, software, and manufacturing teams to identify and resolve issues early in the development cycle.

+ 
Provide feedback to improve product design and manufacturing processes.


**You may be a good fit if you have**

* 
Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, or a related field.

* 
5\\+ years of experience in systems validation, hardware integration, or related roles.

* 
Strong understanding of server architecture and subsystems (power, thermal, storage, networking, PCIe, etc.).

* 
Experience with side\\-band communication protocols, telemetry, and BMC integration.

Full medical, dental, and vision packages, with 100% of premium covered

* 
Housing subsidy of **$2,000/month** for those living within walking distance of the office

* 
Daily lunch and dinner in our office

* 
Relocation support for those moving to West San Jose


**How we’re different**

Etched believes in the Bitter Lesson. We think most of the progress in the AI field has come from using more FLOPs to train and run models, and the best way to get more FLOPs is to build model\\-specific hardware. Larger and larger training runs encourage companies to consolidate around fewer model architectures, which creates a market for single\\-model ASICs.

We are a fully in\\-person team in West San Jose, and greatly value engineering skills. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"zr-71mrq4zAznLzSZB8-s4W7Q","zip_recruiter","https://www.ziprecruiter.com/jobs//j?lvk=71mrq4zAznLzSZB8-s4W7Q","","Product Designer","Ashby","San Francisco, CA, USA","2025-03-29","fulltime","direct_data","yearly",150000.0,200000.0,"USD","","","","organic","","Welcome to Ashby!In modern SaaS development, product teams often consist of a product manager, a designer, and \\~4\\-5 engineers. The product manager briefs the designer who then designs. After designing, mocks are handed to the engineers.   
  
Ashby takes a more principled approach. In actuality, design is required in varying degrees on each project. Sometimes, when using existing components to create yet another settings page, design is only required as a consult. Other times, design should effectively be the product manager and own a project from beginning to end. In these latter cases, it makes sense that the designer is even the one providing project updates and managing resources rather than constantly being pinged by a separate product manager.  
  
This principled approach is what has allowed Ashby to take down incumbents in multiple verticals, all at once. We don't settle for the status quo \\- we actively resist reversion to the mean.  
  
Currently, our Head of Product Design reports to Benji, the co\\-founder \\& CEO. Both Abhik and Benji (our founders) care deeply about design, which at first glance may seem counterintuitive given the number of full\\-time designers that we employ. The belief is not that design is unimportant, but rather that it should be owned by the product team collectively, not solely by a group of full\\-time designers who happen to have the job title.   
  
The design ***department’s*** job at Ashby is not to make every single design decision but to equip our entire product team to make better decisions themselves, as well as edit decisions that PMs/Engineers choose to make. That, while tackling the biggest design challenges ourselves. 

What We’re BuildingTalent teams aspire to build a hiring process that identifies great candidates, moves them quickly through the interview process, and provides an excellent experience for the candidate. To accomplish this, recruiters perform thousands of daily tasks to coordinate and relay information between candidates, interviewers, and hiring managers. Teams struggle to keep up!

Scheduling a final round is an excellent example of our customers' challenges. A recruiter needs to collect availability from the candidate, identify potential interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and perform any last\\-minute adjustments as availability changes. They must perform this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 

Ashby provides talent teams with intelligent and powerful software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered and extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here (and are what we often replace!).

We have many customers, great revenue growth, years of runway, and amazing investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom. I’ll share more once we meet.

Why you should or shouldn’t applyYour qualifications:* 
4\\+ years of product design experience in desktop SaaS.

* 
Able to think from first principles instead of simply applying the “standard” UX processes.

* 
Can break down complex user problems by asking questions that narrow down the solution space.

* 
Enough experience that your intuition can solve many usability problems without having to rely solely on data \\& metrics or conducting user research.

* 
Curious \\& resourceful enough to come up with creative solutions and de\\-risk them appropriately.

* 
Strong skills in layout, navigation, IA, UI, and interaction design.

* 
Strong visual design skills and obsession with craft \\& details.

* 
As a bonus, you have experienceat an early\\-stage startup or have spent time as a solo designer on a team.


You may want to apply if you’re excited about:* 
Creating leverage and impact far and above what you'd see in a typical EPD product team structure. You won’t be a cog in the wheel, the wheel is not very big!

* 
Getting to work on all parts of a massive product surface area \\- spanning many user types, JTBDs, usability challenges, etc. Unlike in other organizations, you won’t be stuck working on one problem for many years.

* 
Helping reinvent the design model for modern enterprise software—you don’t ***have*** to build wireframes, user journeys, personas, etc. What matters is solving a customer’s problem; what tools you use are up to you.

* 
Covering all parts of the design process with a focus on design craft. You'll still be doing the occasional user research interview but will be focused on using heuristics \\& experience to improve our IA, navigation, interactions, UI patterns, and more.

* 
Helping build our design system from (almost) the ground up.


Conversely, you may not want to apply if:* 
You feel uncomfortable designing independently without much guidance from a PM or design management.

* 
You’re uncomfortable having your decisions and process being challenged constantly by engineering \\& product.

* 
You prefer an in\\-person role over remote (Ashby operates remotely).

* 
You dislike written documentation.

* 
You want a set structure and rhythm to your projects.

+ 
PM gives you a brief, you do wireframes, then mocks, then pass off work to engineers. Rinse and repeat.


* 
You prefer a narrow job scope \\- interaction design ***only,*** design system ***only***, etc.


On a weekly basis you will find yourself:* 
Consulting for engineers who need help structuring layout, typography, flows, etc.

* 
Digging into problems by consulting GTM, talking to customers, asking for data requests, and more in order to present confident assumptions about your proposals.

* 
Using Figma to draw out your ideas and create visual artifacts for stakeholder alignment.

* 
Writing specification docs (we call them specs!) that detail your design proposals. These documents are meant to get stakeholder alignment on the biggest decisions you want to make and are a core part of how we work at Ashby.

* 
Taking ownership of larger product features and thinking through Jobs\\-To\\-Be\\-Done, navigation, information architecture, layout, interaction, etc.

* 
Consolidating and refining our design system to be functional, aesthetic, and best\\-in\\-class.


Interview ProcessAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together and talking through decisions. Our interview process is four rounds with some casual Zoom (or in\\-person) coffee in between to get to know each other: 

1. 
30\\-minute introduction call to discuss Ashby and your experience

3. 
45\\-minute portfolio review

5. 
90\\-minute design exercise \\& portfolio review (45m each). Portfolio review is a repeat but with different team members. The exercise can be a take\\-home *or* a live whiteboarding exercise, whichever you're more comfortable with!

7. 
A virtual on\\-site of roughly 2 hrs. This will include meeting the team, a product teardown, and more!


Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prepare you for interviews. You’ll meet other engineers and product managers as well (with 15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback if you'd like it!

Benefits* 
Competitive salary and equity.

* 
*10\\-year exercise window for stock options*. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.

* 
Unlimited PTO with four weeks recommended per year. Expect “Vacation?” in our one\\-on\\-one agenda until you start taking it.

*

AirGarage is repurposing the 30% of real estate in the average American city currently dedicated to parking.

We are building a future where real estate is digitized and can be transitioned from one use to another seamlessly on\\-demand, moving every piece of urban real estate toward its highest and best use.

We are starting with the $131 billion US parking real estate market because it is one of the most offline and mismanaged commercial real estate asset types.

As a full\\-stack parking operator, we automate the operation of parking lots and parking garages. We handle everything from advertising to collecting payments from drivers and enforcing against illegal parking. We already operate 300\\+ parking lots and parking garages across 35 US states and we are growing quickly.

We are backed by top tier investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Floodgate, Founders Fund, and angel investors who have founded or worked at companies like Uber, Opendoor, Flexport, and more.

You'll need experience in the entire recruiting cycle \\- from sourcing to closing candidates \\- and will need the ability to spot talented individuals at various levels of career experience from all types of backgrounds.

You'll be the cornerstone of our recruiting team and will also have significant input into how we build our recruiting process and culture as we scale from dozens to hundreds of employees across the country over the coming years.

**WHAT YOU WILL DO 👷‍♀️**

* 
Assist our Founders and leadership team in scaling our best in class team to better serve our customers.

* 
Spend your days sourcing, contacting, and closing top tier talent across the US and around the world.

* 
Ensure candidates understand what AirGarage is and how we have a unique opportunity as a technology company that interacts with the physical world to impact people's daily lives.

* 
Own our recruiting process from end to end in the early days and help us build out a people team as we scale and our hiring needs increase.

* 
Bring in candidates from a wide variety of sources and guide them through the stages of our hiring pipeline toward close.

* 
Support with non\\-recruiting people related functions such as compensation planning, annual reviews, healthcare, and more.

**🚨 WHY THIS ROLE MAY NOT BE FOR YOU 🚨**

Please review this section before applying. We are sharing this information up front because we don’t expect this job to be appealing to everybody and we do not want to waste your time if you are not on board with all of the following.

Being the first recruiting hire at a high growth startup means many different things, but there is one thing above all that it certainly means: hiring success or failure is ultimately your responsibility.

This will be a hard job. We work long hours at AirGarage, including nights and weekends when necessary, because we love what we do. You will be expected to do the same. We are growing fast but our hiring team is lean, so every day you will have new challenges and too much on your plate, but you’ll be expected to find a way to deliver anyways.

Below are some of the reasons you might not want this job:

* 
You are not excited about being the first (and only, for the time being) recruiting / people team member at an early stage company. You should not take this role if you are not comfortable defining your own process and expect to have a playbook handed to you, because there is no playbook in place today.

* 
You don’t want to be involved in the weeds on every hire, partnering closely with hiring managers to run the entire hiring process from beginning to end, including the nitty gritty tactical work of sourcing, scheduling interviews, creating offers, and everything else involved in running a successful hiring process.

* 
You don’t wake up every day feel energized to source the next great team member that will come to work at AirGarage. Hiring is an extremely rewarding treasure hunt of sorts, and if that isn’t what you live and breathe for and derive immense personal satisfaction from then you likely won’t feel fulfilled in this role.

* 
You aren’t comfortable handling people / HR tasks outside of simply recruiting on an as needed basis.

 Must Have skill : **Cable routing designs exp, AUTOCAD**Notes from the Hiring Manager on the position. 

For example, rail\\-wayside experience can be omitted if the candidate has proven experience in cable routing and layout design.

During our conversation, I recommended considering candidates from similar industries, such as solar panel installation industry.  
 They need to route cables from the power source to the solar panel box and the panel location, find space for their equipment in buildings or houses, and determine the routing.

Another example could be TPSS/subsystem designers, transformer designers, or power plant\\-related designers.  
  
 They primarily need to connect panels to equipment by finding spaces and routing cables.  
  
 For integration, candidates need to demonstrate their ability to assemble multiple parts, not necessarily the same subsystems we use in rail. The examples above illustrate this point.  
  
 However, we do require **cable routing, AutoCAD proficiency**, and the ability to integrate multiple subsystems. These requirements are crucial for the role, and without them, the candidate will not be able to perform the work at a senior level

Clienti is looking for more experience towards Design. Candidate could be from Electrical or Signalling background, but he/she Should have experience on Cable routing between any points. Like for example, electrical substation to the equipment room integrating all other subsystem designs. 

Client is looking for more of a senior resource for this position who has more experience on this kind of designs so that he can start supporting. The project is already started, there is a very less time for learning curve. 

Client is not looking for those who ""know"" these designs but those who already ""designed"" this kind of designs.
