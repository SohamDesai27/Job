Then come join us!
Job Description
What you’ll do  

  

 First thing you need to know: this isn’t a typical retail gig. As a Trek Sales Associate, you’ll be on the frontlines helping people have fun by riding bikes. You’ll get to learn about some of the smartest products in the cycling industry, make thoughtful recommendations to your customers, and carry on meaningful relationships with riders in your community. The pace is fast, the customers are curious, and having an all\\-for\\-one, customer\\-centric team mentality is huge. We value hospitality skills first, and we’d rather hire someone who’s eager to learn than someone who thinks they know it all. If you’re already a bike expert, that’s awesome. If not, we’ll train you. The key is that you know how to treat customers, evaluate their needs, and exceed their expectations.  

  

 What you’ll bring to the team* A positive, pitch\\-right\\-in attitude and motivation to help every customer find what they need
* Fantastic hospitality—a warm, approachable manner, great listening skills, and a drive to help in any way you can—even on the toughest, busiest days
* Great communication with customers and teammates
* A desire to cultivate customer relationships and create your own client base
* A commitment to deliver the best possible cycling experience for each customer


Trek Benefits:* Flexible and fun company culture
* 401(k) with match and Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOP)
* Employee discounts on all product
* Deep partner retail discounts

Your well\\-being and that of your family matters to you, and so it's important to us too. To support you and your loved ones through life's many challenges, we offer our full time employees access to a wide array of benefits including health, dental, vision, life, disability, accident, cancer, flexible spending accounts, health savings accounts, employee assistance, paid holidays, paid sick leave, paid emergency leave, longevity pay, golf course discounts as well as generous retirement and deferred compensation programs and social security participation.  

  

**Medical**  

We offer two types of medical plans (a traditional PPO plan and a high deductible health plan) so that you can choose the one that best fits your needs. The premium you pay is based on which plan you select and who you cover. Covering just yourself? The City currently pays the entire employee\\-only premium for either plan. Covering qualified dependents in your family? Currently, we'll pay your employee premium and split the remainder of the spouse/child/family premium with you \\- we pay 60%; you pay 40%. That generous cost share reflects our philosophy that our employees and their families should have the best health care we can afford to provide.  

  

**Dental**  

Dental plans include a DMO option (no cost for employee\\-only coverage) and two more traditional plans whose premiums are also affordable. You can choose to cover yourself or any qualified dependents and choose which plan best suits your dental needs. Currently, for the DHMO option, we pay the employee premium and split the remainder of the spouse/child/family premiums with you – we pay 50%; you pay 50%. Under the more traditional plans, although we don't pay the entire employee\\-only premium, we still split the incremental dependent premiums with you 50/50\\.  

  

**Vision**  

Access to $10 eye exam co\\-pays and up to $150 frame and contact lens allowances make vision insurance a popular benefit among employees. Cover yourself for just a few bucks a pay period or all of your qualified dependents for not much more.  

  

**Life/AD\\&D**  

Your basic employee $15,000 term life insurance policy is paid for by the city. Accidental Death \\& Dismemberment under the plan would pay an additional $15,000 to your beneficiary if you die in an accident. More life insurance coverage is paid for by the City and provided through our Texas Municipal Retirement System (TMRS) program. If that's still not enough coverage, you can purchase more life/AD\\&D coverage for yourself and your qualified dependents. Over the age of 65? These coverages are subject to an age reduction schedule.  

  

**Disability**  

Both short and long term disability plans which provide up to 60% income replacement are available to purchase at competitive rates.  

  

**Accident \\& Cancer**  

Need extra coverage for off\\-the\\-job medical injuries or a cancer diagnosis? Supplemental plans that pay cash for some of life's most unexpected events are available for purchase.  

  

**Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)**  

Want to set aside some pre\\-tax dollars for health care expenses or dependent care expenses? If you select the traditional EPO medical coverage, you can set aside pre\\-tax money for medical expenses through the City's Section 125 medical FSA plan, which is managed by an outside carrier. You can do the same for dependent day care expenses, regardless of which medical plan you select.  

  

**Health Savings Accounts (HSA)**  

The high deductible health care plan has its own provisions for pre\\-tax health savings (HSA) so you can set aside money for your qualified health care expenses. The City will add $1000 to your health savings account to get you started each plan year.  

  

**Employee Assistance Program**  

We know that sometimes your needs are much different than a doctor visit or a prescription, so the City pays for a generous employee assistance program through Alliance to help you or any household member with counseling, legal referrals or simply a safe ride home.  

  

**Holidays**  

The City has thirteen designated holidays each year.  

  

**Vacation Leave**  

Most full time, regular employees (excluding firefighters on a 24 hour shift schedule and department heads) accrue 3\\.69 hours of vacation time each pay period and are eligible to use that time after just six months of employment. The longer you work for the city, the more vacation time you receive, with those accrual rates going up at 4, 9 and 14\\+ years of service. Never use your vacation time? Don't worry; you can bank up to two times your annual accrued hours before you stop accruing.  

  

**Sick Leave**  

As a full time regular employee (excluding firefighters on a 24 hour shift), you accrue 3\\.69 hours of sick leave each pay period, which you are eligible to use after your first pay period with the city. You can also continue to build your sick leave balance up to 480 hours for those unexpected emergencies.  

  

**Longevity Pay**  

Regular full\\-time employees after they've been employed for one year or more are eligible for an annual payout of $5 for every month of City service. So, while that first year $60 check might not seem like a ton of money, that $1500 check (minus taxes of course) for your 25 years of service which is paid around Thanksgiving will likely help you feel very thankful for a little extra cash for Christmas shopping.  

  

**Retirement**  

All regular full\\-time employees participate in our Texas Municipal Retirement System (TMRS). Your 7% investment each payroll period is matched 2 to 1 by the City and is vested at 5 years. You can retire at age 60 with 5 or more years of service or younger if you have at least 20 years of service. You can also receive service credit for certain types of military service. The City's TMRS plan is one of the most generous retirement plans around.  

  

**Deferred Compensation**  

If saving 7% with a 2 to 1 match through TMRS isn't enough to meet your financial goals, you can stash even more on a pre\\-tax basis through the City's 457 plan. Start or stop saving at any time – up to $18,000 annually if you're under 50, and up to $24,000 if you're older.  

  

**Social Security**  

City of Leander employees also participate in the social security system under FICA regulations.  

  

**Golf Course**  

We have a gorgeous golf course. Want to learn how to play? As a City employee you can play for 50% off. Check it out!","Government","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/City-of-Leander,-Texas","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Starting with his family’s pizzerias, we now empower over tens of thousands of restaurants with the technology, services, and collective power that owners need to better serve their digitally minded customers and build lasting businesses. We’re growing and adding more talent to help fulfill this valuable mission. That’s where you come in.
   

  

**The Opportunity**
 At Slice, our business is built on trust. We are obsessed with ensuring every experience our shop owners have is of the highest quality, helping to ensure we are always making both the shops and their owners better. At the core of this is how our shops experience our products and services for the very first time. This critical role is responsible for leading the execution of a scalable, world\\-class implementation process — including hardware and software installations, seamless product onboarding across all Slice offerings, delivering exceptional customer experiences, and driving operational excellence for pizzeria owners embracing the Slice platform.
   

  

**The Role**
 We are seeking a visionary and customer\\-obsessed Implementation Lead to own the on\\-site process for hardware and software installations, product onboarding, training, and early lifecycle support across all Slice products — including but not limited to Point of Sale, Online Ordering, Phones, and Shop Supplies (The Goods). This role plays a critical part in establishing Slice as a trusted technology partner for our shops, helping them adopt and maximize the value of our full suite of solutions.
   

  

 While this platform has its roots in point\\-of\\-sale, it now extends far beyond POS with Slice’s many pizza\\-centric capabilities. Your work will directly contribute to growing Slice revenue and deepening our relationship with shops by ensuring a seamless onboarding experience and providing hands\\-on education and support.
   

  

 You will partner closely with all Slice sales and post\\-sales teams to support product sales and adoption, and work alongside the Implementation Specialist organization to maximize efficiency, expand our shop base, and reduce churn through strong, lasting relationships with shop owners. This role reports to Slice’s Lead Manager of Implementation Operations.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
* Serve as an on\\-site Installer and Trainer for shops adopting any of our products, including Point of Sale, Online Ordering, Phone, and Supplies, working hand in hand with the rest of the Implementation Specialists
* Own the installation, training, and adoption process for new shops across all products, ensuring shop owners and staff are fully equipped to use our solutions successfully
* Continue the sales journey for shops to keep owners engaged as they move through installation, onboarding, and the early lifecycle of product adoption
* Assist with the success of our shops by providing stellar on\\-site support to ensure a smooth transition and long\\-term adoption of all products
* Solve problems for shop owners and operators in retention cases to ensure that every shop that adopts our products sees their value and remains on the platform
* Work with the Restaurant, Product, and Ops teams to ideate and prioritize new updates, fixes, and features impacting our restaurant network
* Continuously seek out feedback from our restaurant partners and effectively utilize it to ensure that all technology and operational needs are met across our product suite


**What We're Looking For**
 We’re looking for creative, entrepreneurial specialists who are excited to help build world\\-class solutions for small business owners across all our products — from Point of Sale to Online Ordering, Phones, and Shop Supplies. These are the core competencies this role calls for:
   

  

* Preferred 3\\-5 years experience selling, implementing, or managing technology solutions for SMBs, ideally in the restaurant vertical
